# basic model 
# stateful training
# multivariate time series

concatenaed RNN
indiviudal RNN
residual rnn high way layers

dim_per_var 

RNN regularization, mv_cell speed up, 

mv_cell: for stacked lstm

temporal and variate attention

mv_lstmcell speed up 

time decay attention:
  variate specific decay

mv_rnn final speed-up

pure probabilistic model with variance term

dropout set-up

dropout in training and testing phase 

epoch rmse, mae 

--- To do ---


point-wise loss, hidden activiation added into attention

posterir attention on both training and testing data 


initilizaer:

   with tf.variable_scope('RNN', initializer=tf.contrib.layers.xavier_initializer()):
      outputs, state = tf.nn.dynamic_rnn(cell, ...)

Bayesian:
  
  bayesian dropout rnn + attention
