point-wise loss, activiation added into attention

pure probabilistic model via variance term

posterir on both training and testing data 

bayesian dropout rnn + attention

REINFORCE

memory cell

Sequencial loss function 

Baseline: (NIPS 2016)temporal regularized time series, prophet 

normalization the whole or each batch

soft and hart cutoff, impulse function approximate, 

top% accuracy in causal discovery 

model saver, training and testing data, attentions 

Batchnorm, Layer norm

Computation time 

Attention mechinism:  time decay: cikm deephawkes paper 

statistical pre-processing:
  autocorrelation order

some improvements on memory moduel in LSTM 

mixed effect in temporal data: e.g. air pollution data: heterogenous
